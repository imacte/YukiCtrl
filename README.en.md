### üõ†Ô∏è Scheduling Core (YukiCpuScheduler)

The core of YukiCtrl is driven by a high-performance C++ daemon, **YukiCpuScheduler**. It is responsible for executing all low-level system tuning commands, achieving efficient performance control with extremely low resource consumption.

#### Core Features

  * **High-Performance C++ Implementation**: Extremely low system resource usage and minimal power consumption.
  * **Real-time Configuration Monitoring**: Supports configuration hot-reloading, allowing mode switches without a reboot.
  * **Multi-level Optimization Strategy**: Comprehensive tuning from CPU frequency to bus speed.
  * **Smart App Launch Boost**: Temporarily boosts performance when an app starts to speed up loading times.

#### Scheduling Functions

| Feature Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU Frequency Control** | Dynamically adjusts the min/max frequency for each core cluster. |
| **Governor Management** | Supports fine-grained tuning of various governors like schedutil, walt, and their internal parameters. |
| **Core Allocation (Cpuset)** | Assigns appropriate CPU cores to different task groups (foreground, background, etc.), key for managing power and performance. |
| **Bus Frequency Optimization** | Finely controls the frequency of the SoC's internal data bus (LLCC cache/DDR memory), significantly impacting system responsiveness and power consumption. |
| **I/O Scheduler Optimization** | Optimizes storage device access policies and allows for custom I/O schedulers. |
| **EAS Scheduler Tuning** | Advanced parameter optimization for kernels that support Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS). |
| **Core Affinity Optimization** | The `AffinitySetter` provides static core binding for critical system processes, significantly improving UI smoothness. |
| **Conflict Management** | Automatically disables most common userspace and kernel-level performance boosters (like touch boost) to ensure the scheduler's policy is the single source of truth. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration (`config.yaml` Explained)

YukiCtrl uses a YAML-formatted configuration file, allowing for deep customization.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata (`meta`)

This section defines the basic information for the configuration file.

```yaml
meta:
  name: "YukiCpuScheduler Profile"
  author: "yuki"
  loglevel: "INFO"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `configVersion` | number | **Crucial**. This version number must exactly match the version required by the program. |
| `loglevel` | string | Log level detail. Options: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. |

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Toggles (`function`)

This section contains the master switches for all major features.

```yaml
function:
  DisableQcomGpu: true
  AffinitySetter: true
  CpuIdleScaling_Governor: false
  EasScheduler: true
  cpuset: true
  LoadBalancing: true
  EnableFeas: false
  AdjIOScheduler: true
  AppLaunchBoost: true
```

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AffinitySetter` | **(Recommended)** **Do not enable on HyperOS 3**. Performs static core binding for critical system processes, **significantly improving UI smoothness**. |
| `CpuIdleScaling_Governor`| Whether to allow custom CPU Idle governors. |
| `EasScheduler` | If the kernel supports **EAS**, enabling this will apply optimized parameters. |
| `cpuset` | **(Recommended)** Enables the Cpuset feature to assign different task groups to appropriate CPU cores. |
| `LoadBalancing` | Enables CFS load balancing optimizations for more rational task distribution across cores. |
| `EnableFeas` | Whether to attempt enabling the kernel's FEAS feature in **Fast mode**. |
| `AdjIOScheduler` | Whether to allow custom I/O schedulers. |
| `AppLaunchBoost` | **(Recommended)** Enables app launch acceleration to speed up loading times. |

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Framework & Allocation (`CoreFramework` & `CoreAllocation`)

This section defines your device's physical core architecture and is the foundation for all frequency and core control functions. **It must be configured correctly\!**

  * **Core Framework (`CoreFramework`)**: Tells the program which `policy` path corresponds to each core cluster (can be found in the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/` directory).
    ```yaml
    CoreFramework:
      SmallCorePath: 0
      MediumCorePath: 2
      BigCorePath: 5
      SuperBigCorePath: 7
    ```
  * **Core Allocation (`CoreAllocation`)**: Provides parameters for the `AffinitySetter` feature, specifying the core range to which critical system processes will be bound.
    ```yaml
    CoreAllocation:
      cpusetCore: "2-7"
    ```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Bus Frequency Control (`Bus_dcvs_Path` & `Bus_dcvs`)

This feature allows for fine-grained control over the SoC's internal data bus (LLCC cache/DDR memory) frequency. Configuration is a two-step process:

1.  **Global Path Definition (`Bus_dcvs_Path`)**: A **one-time** setup to tell the program where the system files for controlling bus frequency are located. The program intelligently detects which paths you've filled and only acts on those.
    ```yaml
    # Qualcomm platform example
    Bus_dcvs_Path:
      CPUllccminPath: "/sys/devices/system/cpu/bus_dcvs/L3/soc:qcom,memlat:l3:prime/min_freq"
      CPUllccmaxPath: "/sys/devices/system/cpu/bus_dcvs/L3/soc:qcom,memlat:l3:prime/max_freq"
      CPUddrminPath: "/sys/devices/system/cpu/bus_dcvs/DDR/soc:qcom,memlat:ddr:prime/min_freq"
      CPUddrmaxPath: "/sys/devices/system/cpu/bus_dcvs/DDR/soc:qcom,memlat:ddr:prime/max_freq"
    ```
2.  **Per-Mode Value Setting (`Bus_dcvs`)**: Within **each performance mode**, set the specific frequency values to be written.
    ```yaml
    # performance mode example
    performance:
      Bus_dcvs:
        CPUllccmin: 1555000
        CPUddrmax: 3196000
    ```

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Governor Parameters (`pGovPath` & `Govsets`)

This feature allows for fine-tuning the internal parameters of the CPU governor. This is also a two-step process:

1.  **Define Available Parameters (`pGovPath`)**: Create a "parameter dictionary," grouped by **governor name**, defining the **file names** of all parameters you might want to use.
    ```yaml
    pGovPath:
      schedutil:
        path1: "up_rate_limit_us"
      walt:
        path1: "target_loads"
    ```
2.  **Set Parameter Values in Modes (`Govsets`)**: Within **each performance mode**, also grouped by **governor name**, use the **keys** defined in `pGovPath` to set specific **values**. The program will intelligently apply these settings only to the cores currently using that governor.
    ```yaml
    # performance mode example
    performance:
      Govsets:
        schedutil:
          path1: "0"      # Corresponds to up_rate_limit_us
        walt:
          path1: "95"     # Corresponds to target_loads
    ```

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Cpuset (Core Grouping)

Requires `function.cpuset` to be `true`. This restricts different types of task groups to run on specified CPU cores.

| Field | Description | Recommended Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `top_app` | The application currently running in the foreground. | Should be assigned all cores, e.g., `"0-7"`. |
| `foreground` | Foreground services and visible applications. | Should also be assigned all or most cores. |
| `background` | Applications and services running in the background. | **Should be restricted to efficiency cores**, e.g., `"0-3"`, to save power. |
| `system_background` | System background services. | Should also be restricted to efficiency cores. |
| `restricted` | Background apps that are restricted by the system. | Should be assigned the minimum number of cores. |

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Power Model Explained (using `performance` mode as an example)

A complete performance mode is defined by the combination of the following six modules. You can mix and match them to create the perfect mode for your needs.

```yaml
performance:
  Governor: { ... } # Governor: Determines how CPU frequency responds to load
  Freq: { ... }     # CPU Frequency: Defines min/max frequency for each core cluster
  Uclamp: { ... }   # Uclamp: Provides hints to the scheduler about performance needs (0-100)
  Bus_dcvs: { ... } # Bus Frequency: Sets the internal SoC data bus frequency
  Govsets: { ... }  # Governor Parameters: Fine-tunes the behavior of the current governor
  Other: { ... }    # Other settings
```
